Hi, this is me Sara Khanal. I am from Nepal and I am currently studying Information Technology in Ulsan College of South Korea. Itâ€™s been about 6 months since I am in South Korea. 
I passed my high school in the year 2021 . I graduated from school  named Adarsh higher secondary school Banke,Nepal. My major in high school was science (biology+ extra math). I completed my middle school in 2019 from Deep Jyoti Vidyashram School Banke,Nepal.
Talking more about myself  my current major is Information Technology where I am learning Html , JavaScript, coding, presentation and many more. Since my background is Science I do not have much knowledge about my subject however I am slowly doing little progress in this field.
Growing up I was very impressed by hackers in movies. I believe in IT field you have to use your brain more instead of more physical work . I kinda love this as I am very lazy person in general. I do not like to talk to other people easily and I believe IT is the only field where I can work freely without communicating to others and this is what makes me study IT. 
Now come to think of this I really am thinking of being an app developer as I think everyone is obsessed with apps . I want to be an app developer and use my brain to create apps which can really  be used by everyone everyday.
